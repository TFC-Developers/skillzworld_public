# SkillzWorld - Team Fortress Classic Plugin Repository

Welcome to the SkillzWorld Team Fortress Classic (TFC) plugin repository! In 2022, we embarked on a mission to revamp our plugins and transform our servers into a community-driven project. Previously, we utilized a custom-made Metamod plugin. However, we have now transitioned to building new plugins which are partially based on the excellent work of ben-watch/FeckinMad.

## Our Servers
SkillzWorld has been a prominent figure since 2007, hosting a wide array of TFC servers. We have catered to various playstyles with dedicated servers for climbing, different skill-based gameplay, dustbowl maps, deathmatches, a funserver, and even roleplay.

As of 2022, we currently maintain three active servers:
- Climb Server
- Skills Server (featuring conc jumps, rocket jumps, and more)
- Roleplay Server (maintained by vancold)

## Contributing to the Git Repository

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our Git repository! We welcome contributions from the community to help improve our project. To ensure a smooth collaboration process, we kindly request that you follow the guidelines below.

### Creating a Branch

When contributing to the repository, it's important to create a branch for your changes. A branch is an independent line of development that allows you to work on your modifications without affecting the main codebase. This ensures that your changes can be reviewed and merged separately, maintaining a clean and organized repository.

To create a branch, you can use the following command in your Git terminal:

```shell
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

Replace `your-branch-name` with a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of your changes. This branch will serve as the container for your modifications.

### Submitting a Pull Request to `dev` Branch

Once you have completed your changes and are ready for review, it's time to submit a pull request. A pull request is a way to propose your changes to the repository maintainers for review and potential merging into the main codebase.

In our repository, we encourage contributors to submit their pull requests to the `/dev` branch. This branch serves as a staging area where changes are tested and reviewed before being integrated into the main branch. By submitting your pull request to `/dev`, you allow us to thoroughly review your changes and collaborate effectively with other contributors.

To create a pull request, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have committed and pushed all your changes to your branch.
2. Visit the repository on GitHub and switch to the `/dev` branch.
3. Click on the "New pull request" button.
4. Set the base branch as `/dev` and the compare branch as your branch.
5. Provide a descriptive title and a clear summary of your changes.
6. Submit the pull request.

Our team will review your pull request, provide feedback if necessary, and work with you to ensure your changes meet the project's standards. Once your changes are approved, they will be merged into the `/dev` branch and eventually integrated into the main codebase.

### Why This Workflow?

Using branches and pull requests offers several advantages for collaborative development:

1. **Isolation of Changes:** Working in a branch allows you to make modifications without interfering with the main codebase. This promotes a clean and manageable repository, making it easier to review, test, and merge contributions.

2. **Code Review:** Pull requests provide an opportunity for peer review, where other contributors can review your changes, provide feedback, and suggest improvements. This ensures higher code quality and helps catch potential issues early on.

3. **Collaboration:** By submitting your pull request to the `/dev` branch, you join a collaborative space where contributors can interact, test changes, and address conflicts or dependencies before merging into the main branch. It fosters teamwork and reduces the risk of breaking the codebase.

4. **Stability and Reliability:** The `/dev` branch serves as a staging area, allowing us to test and validate changes before merging them into the main branch. This ensures that the main branch remains stable and reliable, avoiding potential disruptions caused by untested code.

Thank you for considering contributing to our Git repository using this workflow. We appreciate your efforts in making our project better and look forward to collaborating with you!
