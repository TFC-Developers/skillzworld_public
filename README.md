# SkillzWorld - Team Fortress Classic
[![Build Status](https://drone.gruk.io/api/badges/TeamFortressClassic/skillzworld_public/status.svg)](https://drone.gruk.io/TeamFortressClassic/skillzworld_public)

Welcome to the plugin repository of skillzworld. In 2022 we decided that it was time to redo the plugins and turn the servers into a community project. Until then we used a custom made metamod plugin. 
Our goal is to build the new plugins on top of the plugins provided by ben-watch / FeckinMad.

## Servers
SkillzWorld was founded in 2007 and hosted a variety of tfc servers such as a climb server, various skill servers, a dustbowl server, a deathmatch server, a funserver and a roleplay.

As of 2022 there are only three servers left:
- Climb
- Skills (conc, rocket jump etc.)
- Roleplay (maintained by vancold)

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Every commit / merge will trigger a build process and will update the plugins on the server.
