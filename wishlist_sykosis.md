# Features
* Allow reverse courses on map that doesn't support it natively
* An API endpoint to be able to retrieve player stats on the server
* Add ammo on /give all command or fix maps that doesn't provide rockets
* Some maps can be somehow "cheated" in order to get to last jump or get to the timer
* ¿New selection map? :D
* Permanent noclip option that disables points reward and time. This allows to practice specific jumps that
may take time to get on in different sessions.
  * Save position option when disconnecting from server as a toggle option (off by default)?
  * Teleport system to specific jumps?
  * Some kind of indicator above player heads as we do with timer could be fancy
* Unstuck command
* You can still beat the maps while using teleporting systems but you cannot speedrun if you use them.(so if you use tp then there will be a menu to stop timer to use it.)!
* Limited nades for specific maps(Multiskillz had them. For example."You have only one nade allowed to use on concmap_exist".)(If you wanna unlimited nades then you need to stoptimer to continue using /nades(are you sure 1-yes 2-no if its yes you can still beat the map but you wont able to speedrun it!)
* Advanced output for each players skillsrank statistics.(For example: runs for all classes if there is any.)(Soldier: 1. 00:12:24.(38) on 28.05.2023 at 22:51 by Xplayer)<=example output when you typed /r or /sr) 
* /noclip feature(if you wanna use this feature , you wont be able to speedrun and finish maps so you will be red glowed and blocked timers for players.)(Player can understand who cant speedrun the maps)(thats what multiskillz had)
* Green glow while speedrunning.(if you use /noclip feature then it will be red glow and wont be able to speedrun and even cannot finish maps.)

# Changes
* Players collide toggle option (false by default)
* Block rockets / pipes affecting other players (as conc blast)
* Top 5 times by unique players
* Split records (top5, best by class, all time record) times by each course type (forward, backward, expert and such)
* Remove xmas theme, we are almost in June!
  
# Map specific
* conc_groove2 / conc_groove3: Expert (concatenate some jumps) rewards same points as Forward (one by one)
* conc_groove: crashes server
* concmap_gir3: missing timer. Somewhat around 82. 

# Bugs
* When doing an RTV and panel breaking, panel will take precedence
* Some people said dizzy effect is broken but I think is in the base game, not server related
* Model plugin is broken, when you saved your model, you lose it after map change.





# Pictures in this repo
* Sykosis 1:
the menu on the left when you type /fm on multiskillz
the output when you typed /ps or /skillme
ps(personel stats) thats what multiskillz had

* Sykosis 2:
and this is when you type /r ,/sr or /speedruns
if there is too much datas, there will be a menu just like left side to show specific class runs

* Sykosis 3:
this is what when you selected your last 20 maps output on /fm
ther was too much datas(all me :D) so it printed out in console


# Additional wishes
it was hard to explain so I posted extra  here
np
btw I forgot that is /stop to stoptimer pls xD
there was even /pause function but dunno how to explain it also
